\section{Introduction}

Using Modron briv farming is an advance technique use to gem farm in Idle champion.
This guide is an improvement on the work of Zeke et al (todoref) hopefully clearing some things up, and adding some knowledge over this technique that we learn by discussing this on the discord (todoref).

It looks to use \textbf{briv} which is the single most powerful speed champion in the game at this time.
Briv is able to jump over one or many areas thanks to his unnatural haste ability.

This is not a plug and play guide.
It is heavily dependent on your favors, champions, gears and multiple others.
You need to understand it in order to set it up.
If you do not understand it, it means this guide may be improved, so let me know !
Moreover, it might be a bit intimidating at first.
But don't loose hope !
Once you get it, you'll be able to set up anywhere you'll like !

We start here by giving you some definitions that will ease the comprehension of the technique.
Particularly, we set the definitions of multiple Idle Champion defined concepts as well as adding a few of ours.
