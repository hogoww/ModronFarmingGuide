I stopped "playing" the game for a while now.
I'm tired of dealing with their "improvement" that were breaking my gem farms.


Here's the review I left on steam:  
Multiple thousand of hours of play time on Epic Game.  

This is a nice game for the early/mid game.  
However do not look at the late game.  

There are many development issues that are never addressed.  
Late game content is released, then abandoned, and never addressed.  
Player raise important questions that are not addressed either.  

Many quality of life feature are so lacking that players (including me) have been developing tools to fix some of them.  
However, the more they release bad content, the more those players (including me) leave, and will leave the tools behind.  
Most of those tools are closed sources as well, so...  
Lost.  

The more you play, the more you see problems with how the game is handled by the team.  
Finally, I have seen it become more and more predatory in its way to do a freetoplay.  

TL;DR: Good game, but don't think that it'll old long term.
